# This is a challange project where we create a new game of guess the number.

# GAME REQUIERMENTS

# The game should be able to be launched on the terminal and accept the name argument
# The computer will randomly select 1, 2 or 3
# The computer will promt the player "Player, guess which number I'm thinking of... 1, 2, or 3."

# The player will guess between the numbers 1, 2 or 3.
# The player will only be able to input the three choices ONLY, error return if not chosen.

# The output should show results of both computer & player choices, who wins, count the games played, winning percentage, play again Y or Q, thanks for playing,  game should be personalised.
# To play type the following into the terminal: -
# py guess_number.py -n [INSERT NAME] *Make sure in the corect directory
